Crypto is a fullstack program using Python and the MySql version of SQL. The GUI is implemented using Tkinter.

Crypto, a cryptography and encryption service and database, allows a user to encode/encrypt their messages and then save and edit them. 

Access to Crypto is limited by a Login Page, where a user must sign in. New users may start an account by clicking the botton message. Once signed in, a user will have complete control over THEIR OWN MESSAGES. No user may access another user's messages unless they also have the login info of the other user.

Currently, the different Encryption/Cryptographic services that Crypto provides are:
   - Caesar Cipher
   - Hex
   - Base32
   - Book Cipher (achieved by the user uploading a text file to the interface.)
   - AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
